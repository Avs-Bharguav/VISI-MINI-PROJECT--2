# VISI-MINI-PROJECT--2
Noise, Delay and Power Analysis of CMOS inverter build using skywater130nm pdk  
## Softwares  
*esim* - Schematic drawing and netlist generation.  
*Nspice* - For graphical analysis, delay calculations, power analysis, dc and transieant analysis and noise calculations.  

## DC Analysis  
You can go to the DC_l=1 w=2 folder and check the screenshorts for the esim schematic settings.  
Here following is the schematic and the output viewed using ngspice. In the folder you can also find the ngspice codes used like for ploting 
plot vout vin.
